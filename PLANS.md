# PLANS.md

Source of truth for this plan:

- `README.md` for current platform scope and target model
- `docs/four-week-project-plan.md` for the delivery-focused 4-week MVP plan
- `dashboard-ui/src/App.tsx` for current React implementation reality
- `docs/dashboard-ia-spec.md` for the next dashboard design direction

## Current Baseline

The repo already shows a strong end-to-end electricity demo:

- scheduled ingestion with EventBridge -> Lambda
- raw landing in S3
- Glue crawler + ETL pattern for curated data
- Athena query layer
- generated dashboard outputs
- React + TypeScript dashboard scaffold

The current implementation is still uneven across domains and UI depth:

- electricity is the clearest implemented path
- gas is part of the README target model, but should be treated as the next major platform extension
- the React app exposes navigation for `Overview`, `Portfolio Risk`, `Market Context`, and `Data Quality`, but only `Overview` and `Data Quality` have meaningful implementation today

## Delivery Order

### Phase 1: Stabilize Ingestion And Lakehouse

Goal: make the ingestion and transformation flow dependable before expanding the analytical surface area.

Working checklist: `docs/phase-1-stabilize-ingestion-lakehouse.md`

Focus:

- keep scheduled ingestion reliable and repeatable
- confirm source freshness and schema consistency
- improve run evidence for ingestion, crawler, ETL, and Athena outputs
- tighten data quality checks around missing settlements, freshness, and source coverage
- keep diagrams, README, and dashboard outputs aligned with actual implemented behavior

Definition of stable:

- scheduled ingestion runs consistently without manual repair
- crawler and ETL outputs are reproducible
- Athena-backed outputs are trustworthy enough to feed dashboard pages
- data quality checks make incomplete or stale data obvious

### Phase 2: Implement Gas End-To-End

Goal: move ENTSOG gas from target-model intent into the same practical lakehouse flow used for electricity.

Focus:

- finalize gas raw dataset contracts from ENTSOG inputs
- define curated gas schema under the README target layout
- implement Glue transformation for gas datasets
- expose curated gas data through Athena
- update dashboard JSON generation to include gas-aware derived outputs where appropriate
- update docs and diagrams so gas is described consistently across storage, ETL, Athena, and presentation layers

Definition of done:

- gas data lands in raw S3
- gas data is transformed into curated form
- gas data is queryable in Athena
- README, diagrams, and generated outputs all reflect that implemented state

### Phase 3: Expand The React Dashboard

Goal: turn the current overview-first React shell into a multi-page decision-support dashboard.

This phase starts only after:

- the ingestion layer is stable
- the gas pipeline is implemented end-to-end

#### 3A. Portfolio Risk

Future development based on `docs/dashboard-ia-spec.md` and the current React navigation:

- implement a real `Portfolio Risk` page instead of reusing the overview shell
- add margin, open exposure, hedge cover, and breached-book KPI strip
- add P&L by book views
- add hedge coverage vs target views
- add hedge cost vs market price views
- add a fuller risk table with row highlighting and investigation pathways

Why later:

- this page depends on stable commercial metrics and trustworthy cross-dataset outputs
- it becomes more valuable once both electricity and gas are represented in the platform model

#### 3B. Market Context

Future development based on `docs/dashboard-ia-spec.md` and the current React navigation:

- implement a real `Market Context` page
- separate external market conditions from the portfolio story
- add deeper price trend views across selected ranges
- add demand trend views across selected ranges
- add intraday profile views
- add regime callouts such as elevated-price or abnormal-demand conditions

Why later:

- the current overview already includes a market context footer
- the standalone page should be introduced only after the underlying data pipeline is stable enough to support richer exploration

#### 3C. Data Quality

The React app already treats `Data Quality` as a distinct view. After ingestion stability and gas rollout:

- extend freshness checks across all supported sources
- show gas-specific coverage and completeness checks
- surface latest successful ingestion, crawler, ETL, and dashboard-generation timestamps
- make quality status easier to compare across electricity and gas

## Suggested Immediate Next Steps

1. Validate the clean run path end-to-end so README, evidence, and diagrams stay grounded in reproducible platform behavior.
2. Confirm the ingestion + crawler + ETL evidence path is still reproducible from a clean run.
3. Define the gas curated schema and Athena exposure as the next substantive platform feature.
4. Keep `Portfolio Risk` and `Market Context` as explicitly planned React follow-ons after gas and ingestion stability are in place.
5. Use `docs/four-week-project-plan.md` when executing the news summaries, AI merge, and insight dashboard MVP.

## Planning Rule

If implementation reality and design ambition diverge, update this file in the following order:

1. `README.md` reflects current intended platform truth.
2. `PLANS.md` reflects delivery sequence from that truth.
3. diagrams and React pages reflect what is actually implemented now versus what is still future work.
